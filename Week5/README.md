# Action classification on HMDB51

## Download the dataset

0. Before downloading any data, install the `unrar` and `ffmpeg` packages with your package manager. In Debian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu), this is done with the following command: `sudo apt install unrar ffmpeg`.

1. Now, download the videos from the authors' website and decompress them with `unrar`:

    ```bash
        # Download the compressed dataset
        $ wget http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hmdb51_org.rar
        # Extract the file
        $ unrar x hmdb51_org.rar
        # Rename the decompressed folder from hmdb51_org -> videos
        $ mv hmdb51_org videos
        # Inspect the contents of the uncompressed folder
        $ ls videos
    ```

You should be seeing 51 folders, one for each action category (`brush_hair`, `cartwheel`, etc) containing video data (`.avi` files):

    ```
        videos/
        |____ brush_hair/
        |     |____ April_09_brush_hair_u_nm_np1_ba_goo_0.avi
        |     |____ April_09_brush_hair_u_nm_np1_ba_goo_1.avi
        |     |____ ...
        |
        |____ cartwheel/
        |     |____ ...
        |
        |____ ...
    ```

However, for our training procedure, it'll be much more convenient having the videos converted to frames first. Frames are faster to read than video and allow selective access depending on how we decide to sample clips.

## Data preparation

To extract the frames in a directory named `frames`, we can run this long one-line command:

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the same directory that contains the videos/ folder
    $ find videos -name "*.avi" -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} sh -c 'original="{}"; modified=$(echo "$original" | sed -e "s|videos|frames|" | sed -e "s|\.[^.]*$||"); mkdir -p $modified; ffmpeg -i $original -loglevel error $modified/frame%05d.jpg'
    ```
    
If run correctly, such command will create  `frames/` directory with the same structure as `videos/`, but replacing each video file by a directory containing the frames (in .jpg format). It might take from 30' to an hour to extract the frames (depending on your CPU).

Graphically:

    ```
    frames/
    |____ brush_hair/
    |     |____ April_09_brush_hair_u_nm_np1_ba_goo_0/
    |     |     |____ frame00001.jpg
    |     |     |____ frame00002.jpg
    |     |     |____ frame00003.jpg
    |     |     |____ ...
    |     |____ April_09_brush_hair_u_nm_np1_ba_goo_1/
    |           |____ frame00001.jpg
    |           |____ frame00002.jpg
    |           |____ frame00003.jpg
    |           |____ ...
    |
    |____ cartwheel/
    |     |____ ...
    |
    |____ ...
    ```

## Custom groundtruth

Do not download and use the groundtruth annotations from the authors' webpage, as we will be using a modified version that you'll find in `data/hmbd51/testTrainMulti_601030_splits` directory of this same repository.

Differently from the original groundtruth, we will reserve part of the training videos for validation. In particular, instead of having 70% training and 30% testing data, we will have 60% training, 10% validation, and 30% testing.

Then, just take into account that HMDB51 was thought to be evaluated in 3-fold cross validation. So you will see 3 different splits, namely split1, split2, and split3. In the provided annotations, this splits are done in a separate file for each action label (i.e, `<action_label>_test_split<1, 2, or 3>.txt`). However, we will focus on split1 only (ignore split2 and split3 files). Go and examine any `<action_label>_test_split1.txt` file and you'll find there's a line per video. Each line has the video name followed by an integer that represents the partition (train = 1, validation = 3 or test = 2) for this particular split.

## Run the baseline code

0. You'll also need to install the required Python dependencies. These are in the `requirements.txt` file. Assuming you are using PIP, you can then just run:

    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Finally, the baseline can be run executing the `src/train.py` script, which expects one positional argument (the directory containing the frames that we've created before), but accepts other multiple arguments:

    ```
    $ python3 src/train.py --help
        usage: train.py [-h] [--annotations-dir ANNOTATIONS_DIR]
                        [--clip-length CLIP_LENGTH] [--crop-size CROP_SIZE]

                        [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--batch-size-eval BATCH_SIZE_EVAL]
                        [--validate-every VALIDATE_EVERY] [--num-workers NUM_WORKERS]
                        [--device DEVICE]

    ```

If not specified, default values should allow you to run the script without issues.

Check the implementation to understand the different parts of the code.

## Additional files
During this week, we have added new files for the tasks. We divided them into different folders, according to the original division (datasets, models, utils).

#### Datasets
* `HMDB51DatasetTemporal.py`: This file includes the definition for the HMDB51 dataset plus all the required code for dividing videos into a defined number of clips.
* `HMDB51DatasetSpatial.py`: This file includes the definition for the HMDB51 dataset plus all the required code for dividing videos into clips, and each frame of every clip dividing it into five cropped images.  
* `TSNDataset.py`: This file includes the definition for the TSN dataset, required for task number four.

#### Models
We have only added a function into the `model_creator.py` file that allows the user to use the original model `x3d_xs` with the layers already trained frozen. 

#### Utils
* `early_stopping.py`: Definition of the Early Stopping class that allows for using early stopping methodology.
* `plots.py`: File that contains a helper class for plotting per class accuracies.

#### Others
* `eval.py`: Evaluation script for baseline model.
* `generate_class_acc.py`: Script for generating per class accuracy plots and saving them.
* `train_early_stopping.py`: Script used for training the model with early stopping, used for task 2.
